```scss

@import "{{ site.theme }}";
```
// ### Stylesheet

// If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

// 1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
// 2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
//     ```scss
//     ---
//     ---

//     @import "{{ site.theme }}";
//     ```
// 3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

// *Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*
